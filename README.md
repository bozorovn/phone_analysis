# phone_analysis
phone analysis in SQL, Python, and data visualization in Tablueue
In this project, I initiated the process by cleaning and analyzing a phone dataset. Leveraging data cleaning techniques and analytical methods, I aimed to gain comprehensive insights from the dataset.

Subsequently, I transitioned to the development phase where I crafted an engaging and informative dashboard. The dashboard serves as a visual representation of the analyzed data, providing an accessible and user-friendly interface to interact with the findings.

The objective of this project is to showcase the journey from data preprocessing to the creation of an intriguing dashboard, highlighting the valuable insights derived from the phone dataset.
